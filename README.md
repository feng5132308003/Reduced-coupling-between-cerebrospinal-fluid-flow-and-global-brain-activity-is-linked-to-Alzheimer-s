 The file included 19 Matlab scripts and one Python code (run the linear mixed effect model) corresponding to the Fig. 1-4, Fig. S1-S12, table 1, and table S1 in our manuscript.
 
 NOTE: According to the data use policy of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), both the raw and aggregate/summarized data can only be accessed when the data-user applied for ADNI data access and signed the data use agreement. We thus did not upload the ADNI data here. You may request the data used in the scripts from the first author (Feng Han) or the corresponding author (Dr. Xiao Liu) once you have the permission to access the ADNI data.
