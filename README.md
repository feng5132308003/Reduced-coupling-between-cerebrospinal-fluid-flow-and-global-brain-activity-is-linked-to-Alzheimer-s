# Reduced-coupling-between-cerebrospinal-fluid-flow-and-global-brain-activity-is-linked-to-Alzheimer-s

 The instruction of code files for research article "Reduced coupling between cerebrospinal fluid flow and global brain activity is linked to Alzheimer's disease related pathology".
 
 Edited by Feng Han in Multimodal and Computational Neuroimaging Laborary (MCNL) at Pennsylvania State University.
 

 
 The file included 19 Matlab scripts and one Python code (run the linear mixed effect model) corresponding to the Fig. 1-4, Fig. S1-S12, table 1, and table S1 in our manuscript.
 
 NOTE: please see the data used to derive the above figures at the "data_figs.xlsx". In this excel file, we included multiple sheets including/indicating the data corresponding to each figrue. 
 
 
Updates: the summarized data used in the above scripts have been uploaded. According to the ADNI data use policy, we here did not share the identificable ID for each subject, but we share simulated ID in our excel file.

Please send feedback to Feng Han (fzh21@psu.edu).
