 The file included 17 Matlab scripts corresponding the Fig. 1-4 and Fig. S1-S12 in our manuscript.
 
 NOTE: According the data use policy of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), both the raw and aggregate/summarized data can only be accessed when the data-user applied for ADNI data access and sign the data use agreement. We thus did not upload the ADNI data here. You may request the data used in the scripts from the first author (Feng Han) or the corresponding author (Dr. Xiao Liu) once you have the permission to access the ADNI data.
